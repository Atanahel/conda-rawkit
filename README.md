# conda-rawkit

Building recipe for a conda package for [rawkit](https://github.com/photoshell/rawkit).

Currently links the v0.5.0 release of rawkit, and patches it to get the correct binding with the libraw library installed by the corresponding [dependency conda package](https://github.com/Atanahel/conda-libraw)
